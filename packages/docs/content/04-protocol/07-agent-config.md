# Agent Config

The `agent` section configures the LLM model, system prompt, tools, and behavior.

## Basic Configuration

```yaml
agent:
  model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
  system: system # References prompts/system.md
  tools: [get-user-account] # Available tools
  mcpServers: [figma, browser] # MCP server connections
  skills: [qr-code] # Available skills
  references: [api-guidelines] # On-demand context documents
```

## Configuration Options

| Field                 | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| `anthropic`           | No       | Anthropic-specific options (tools, skills)                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Models

Specify models in `provider/model-id` format. Any model supported by the provider's SDK will work.

### Supported Providers

| Provider  | Format                 | Examples                                                                                           |
| --------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Anthropic | `anthropic/{model-id}` | `claude-opus-4-7`, `claude-opus-4-6`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `claude-sonnet-4-5`, `claude-haiku-4-5` |
| Google    | `google/{model-id}`    | `gemini-3.5-flash`, `gemini-3-flash-preview`, `gemini-2.5-flash`                                   |
| OpenAI    | `openai/{model-id}`    | `gpt-5`, `gpt-4o`, `o4-mini`, `o3`, `o3-mini`, `o1`                                                |
| xAI       | `x-ai/{model-id}`      | `grok-4.6`, `grok-4.5`                                                                             |

### Examples

```yaml
# Anthropic Claude 4.5
agent:
  model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5

# Google Gemini 3
agent:
  model: google/gemini-3-flash-preview

# OpenAI GPT-5
agent:
  model: openai/gpt-5

# OpenAI reasoning models
agent:
  model: openai/o3-mini

# xAI Grok
agent:
  model: x-ai/grok-4.6
```

> **Note**: Model IDs are passed directly to the provider SDK. Check the provider's documentation for the latest available models.

### Dynamic Model Selection

The model field can also reference an input variable, allowing consumers to choose the model when creating a session:

```yaml
input:
  MODEL:
    type: string
    description: The LLM model to use

agent:
  model: MODEL # Resolved from session input
  system: system
```

When creating a session, pass the model:

```typescript
const sessionId = await client.agentSessions.create('my-agent', {
  MODEL: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5',
});
```

This enables:

- **Multi-provider support** - Same agent works with different providers
- **A/B testing** - Test different models without protocol changes
- **User preferences** - Let users choose their preferred model

The model value is validated at runtime to ensure it's in the correct `provider/model-id` format.

> **Note**: When using dynamic models, provider-specific options (like `anthropic:`) may not apply if the model resolves to a different provider.

## Backup Model

Configure a fallback model that activates automatically when the primary model encounters a transient provider error (rate limits, outages, timeouts):

```yaml
agent:
  model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
  backupModel: openai/gpt-4o
  system: system
```

When a provider error occurs, the system retries once with the backup model. If the backup also fails, the original error is returned.

**Key behaviors:**

- Only transient provider errors trigger fallback - authentication and validation errors are not retried
- Provider-specific options (like `anthropic:`) are only forwarded to the backup model if it uses the same provider
- For streaming responses, fallback only occurs if no content has been sent to the client yet

Like `model`, `backupModel` supports variable references:

```yaml
input:
  BACKUP_MODEL:
    type: string
    description: Fallback model for provider errors

agent:
  model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
  backupModel: BACKUP_MODEL
  system: system
```

> **Tip**: Use a different provider for your backup model (e.g., primary on Anthropic, backup on OpenAI) to maximize resilience against single-provider outages.

## System Prompt

The system prompt sets the agent's persona and instructions. The `input` field controls which variables are available to the prompt - only variables listed in `input` are interpolated.

```yaml
agent:
  system: system # Uses prompts/system.md
  input:
    - COMPANY_NAME
    - PRODUCT_NAME
```

Variables in `input` can come from `protocol.input`, `protocol.resources`, or `protocol.variables`.

### Input Mapping Formats

```yaml
# Array format (same name)
input:
  - COMPANY_NAME
  - PRODUCT_NAME

# Array format (rename)
input:
  - CONTEXT: CONVERSATION_SUMMARY  # Prompt sees CONTEXT, value comes from CONVERSATION_SUMMARY

# Object format (rename)
input:
  CONTEXT: CONVERSATION_SUMMARY
```

The left side (label) is what the prompt sees. The right side (source) is where the value comes from.

### Example

`prompts/system.md`:

```markdown
You are a friendly support agent for {{COMPANY_NAME}}.

## Your Role

Help users with questions about {{PRODUCT_NAME}}.

## Guidelines

- Be helpful and professional
- If you can't help, offer to escalate
- Never share internal information
```

## Agentic Mode

Enable multi-step tool calling:

```yaml
agent:
  model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
  system: system
  tools: [get-user-account, search-docs, create-ticket]
  agentic: true # LLM can call multiple tools
  maxSteps: 10 # Limit cycles to prevent runaway
```

**How it works:**

1. LLM receives user message
2. LLM decides to call a tool
3. Tool executes, result returned to LLM
4. LLM decides if more tools needed
5. Repeat until LLM responds or maxSteps reached

## Output Limits and Loop Guard

Two optional safeguards bound the cost of a single LLM generation. Both apply **per generation** (one agentic step), not across the whole run - `maxSteps` is what bounds how many steps a run can take.

```yaml
agent:
  model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
  system: system
  maxOutputTokens: 32000 # hard cap on output tokens per generation
  loopGuard: true # abort a generation that degenerates into a repeated string
```

### maxOutputTokens

Caps the output tokens of a single generation, passed straight through to the provider's `max_tokens`. When omitted, the provider/SDK default applies - it varies by model and can be very large. Setting an explicit value gives you a predictable, model-independent ceiling on the cost of any one generation.

This is a **per-step** cap, not a budget for the whole run. A long agentic run makes many generations, each capped independently; use `maxSteps` to bound the number of steps.

### loopGuard

Autoregressive models can occasionally degenerate into a repetition loop - emitting the same short string thousands of times until the output budget is exhausted. Set `loopGuard: true` to watch the streamed output and abort a generation as soon as it detects a short unit repeating past a threshold, so a degenerate turn stops after a few hundred tokens instead of burning the full output cap. The runaway tail is trimmed out of the stored message so it does not pollute later turns.

It is a plain on/off flag - the detection thresholds (how many consecutive repeats trip it, the longest unit considered) are fixed, conservative defaults, since they describe a degeneration detector rather than anything worth tuning per agent. Omit `loopGuard` (or set it to `false`) to disable it.

## Image Delivery Limits

Model providers impose image constraints that change over time - most notably a maximum dimension per image, and stricter caps once a request carries many images. Set `maxImageDimension` to cap the longest side (in pixels) of every image in the model's view:

```yaml
agent:
  model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
  system: system
  maxImageDimension: 2000 # downscale any image above 2000px on its longest side
```

- On every request, an image whose longest side exceeds the cap is delivered **downscaled to fit** (aspect ratio preserved).
- The cap only touches the images it actually changes. An image already within it is delivered exactly as it would be with no cap set - same bytes, same delivery path, no re-encoding and no quality change - so setting a cap costs nothing for the images it does not affect.
- This is a **model-view transform only**. Your stored conversation history, the files surface, and download URLs always keep the original full-resolution bytes, so nothing is lost.
- It is deterministic (the same image and cap always produce the same delivered bytes), so prompt caching is unaffected.
- Omit the field to deliver images at full resolution and rely on whatever the provider does on its own.

Setting `maxImageDimension` is the recommended way to keep image-heavy sessions (screenshots, generated images, uploaded assets) from failing on a provider's per-image dimension limit. For agents that also declare [`contextManagement`](/docs/protocol/context-management), a reactive safety net additionally recovers from image-count and byte limits (and from a provider tightening its limits below your cap) - see that page. Every adaptation is recorded in the session trace, so you can always see what the model actually received.

`maxImageDimension` is also available per worker on the [`start-thread`](/docs/protocol/workers) block.

## Extended Thinking

Enable extended reasoning for complex tasks:

```yaml
agent:
  model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
  thinking: medium # low | medium | high | max
```

| Level    | Use Case                           |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `low`    | Simple reasoning                   |
| `medium` | Moderate complexity                |
| `high`   | Complex analysis                   |
| `max`    | Maximum reasoning budget available |

Thinking content streams to the UI and can be displayed to users.

### How levels are applied

Each provider translates `thinking` into its own reasoning controls:

| Provider                                                                   | Level mapping                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## Prompt Caching

Providers charge less for tokens served from their prompt cache (often 10% of the uncached rate). Octavus exposes a single `cache` field that picks the right retention policy per provider, so the stable prefix of your agent - tools, system prompt, and historical messages - gets billed at the cache-read rate on repeat requests.

```yaml
agent:
  model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
  cache: auto # auto (default) | extended | off
```

| Mode       | Behavior                                                                      | When to use                                                                                             |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `auto`     | Short-TTL caching. Default when omitted.                                      | Most agents. Free on all supported providers and pays for itself within the same session.               |
| `extended` | Long-TTL caching. Trades a higher cache-write cost for much longer residency. | Agents triggered with gaps (daily reports, on-call assistants) where the prefix is reused across hours. |
| `off`      | No opt-in caching emitted.                                                    | When you explicitly want to skip caching - e.g. debugging a non-deterministic prefix.                   |

### Per-provider behavior

The `cache` field is provider-agnostic at the protocol level - each provider translates it into its own cache retention policy:

| Provider  | `auto` TTL                | `extended` TTL |
| --------- | ------------------------- | -------------- |
| Anthropic | 5 minutes                 | 1 hour         |
| OpenAI    | in-memory (~5-10 minutes) | 24 hours       |
| Google    | Implicit (Gemini 2.5+)    | Implicit       |

On `off`, Octavus emits no explicit cache options. Providers that auto-cache (OpenAI on prefixes ≥ 1,024 tokens, Gemini 2.5+) may still cache transparently - `off` just disables Octavus's opt-in behavior.

### Threads don't inherit

Named threads (created with `start-thread`) read their own `cache` field independently - they **do not** inherit the agent's cache value:

```yaml
agent:
  cache: extended # 1-hour TTL on the main thread

handlers:
  summarize:
    Start summary:
      block: start-thread
      thread: summary
      # No cache field → defaults to 'auto' (5-minute TTL), NOT 'extended'
      system: summary-system
```

This is intentional: named threads are often used for short, one-shot work (summarization, classification) where the long TTL would be wasted. Set `cache` explicitly on `start-thread` when you do want it.

### Cost trade-offs

- **Cache reads** are always much cheaper than uncached input on any provider - caching is effectively free if your prefix is stable.
- **Cache writes** on Anthropic cost ~1.25× input for `auto` and 2× input for `extended`. OpenAI and Google don't charge separately for cache writes.
- Use `extended` only when the same prefix is genuinely reused across sessions that span hours; otherwise the higher write cost dominates the savings.

## Skills

Enable Octavus skills for code execution and file generation:

```yaml
skills:
  qr-code:
    display: description
    description: Generating QR codes

agent:
  model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
  system: system
  skills: [qr-code] # Enable skills
  agentic: true
```

Skills provide provider-agnostic code execution in isolated sandboxes. When enabled, the LLM can execute Python/Bash code, run skill scripts, and generate files.

See [Skills](/docs/protocol/skills) for full documentation.

## References

Enable on-demand context loading via reference documents:

```yaml
agent:
  model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
  system: system
  references: [api-guidelines, error-codes]
  agentic: true
```

References are markdown files stored in the agent's `references/` directory. When enabled, the LLM can list available references and read their content using `octavus_reference_list` and `octavus_reference_read` tools.

See [References](/docs/protocol/references) for full documentation.

## Image Generation

Enable the LLM to generate images autonomously:

```yaml
agent:
  model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
  system: system
  imageModel: google/gemini-2.5-flash-image
  agentic: true
```

When `imageModel` is configured, the `octavus_generate_image` tool becomes available. The LLM can decide when to generate images based on user requests. The tool supports both text-to-image generation and image editing/transformation using reference images.

### Supported Image Providers

| Provider | Model Types                             | Examples                                                  |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| OpenAI   | Dedicated image models                  | `gpt-image-1`                                             |
| Google   | Gemini native (contains "image")        | `gemini-2.5-flash-image`, `gemini-3-flash-image-generate` |
| Google   | Imagen dedicated (starts with "imagen") | `imagen-4.0-generate-001`                                 |

> **Note**: Google has two image generation approaches. Gemini "native" models (containing "image" in the ID) generate images using the language model API with `responseModalities`. Imagen models (starting with "imagen") use a dedicated image generation API.

### Aspect Ratios and Resolution

The tool advertises `aspectRatio` - and, for models that support it, `resolution` - narrowed to what the configured model can actually produce. `aspectRatio` defaults to `1:1`; a ratio outside a model's set is clamped to the nearest supported one.

Supported aspect ratios by model family:

| Model family                     | Supported aspect ratios                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Gemini native (`gemini-*-image`) | `1:1`, `2:3`, `3:2`, `3:4`, `4:3`, `4:5`, `5:4`, `9:16`, `16:9`, `21:9` |
| Imagen (`imagen-*`)              | `1:1`, `3:4`, `4:3`, `9:16`, `16:9`                                     |
| `gpt-image-*`                    | `1:1`, `3:2`, `2:3`                                                     |
| `dall-e-3`                       | `1:1`, `16:9`, `9:16`                                                   |

Resolution is a Gemini 3 image feature. When a model has no resolution axis, the `resolution` field is not offered and any value is ignored (the model produces its default 1K output).

| Model                  | Supported resolutions      |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `gemini-3-*-image`     | `1K` (default), `2K`, `4K` |
| All other image models | none (effectively 1K)      |

### Image Editing with Reference Images

Both the agentic tool and the `generate-image` block support reference images for editing and transformation. When reference images are provided, the prompt describes how to modify or use those images.

| Provider | Models                           | Reference Image Support |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| OpenAI   | `gpt-image-1`                    | Yes                     |
| Google   | Gemini native (`gemini-*-image`) | Yes                     |
| Google   | Imagen (`imagen-*`)              | No                      |

### Agentic vs Deterministic

Use `imageModel` in agent config when:

- The LLM should decide when to generate or edit images
- Users ask for images in natural language

Use `generate-image` block (see [Handlers](/docs/protocol/handlers#generate-image)) when:

- You want explicit control over image generation or editing
- Building prompt engineering pipelines
- Images are generated at specific handler steps

## Video

Video is two separate capabilities: understanding video (as model input) and generating video (as model output). Both are Google-centric today.

### Understanding video

To let an agent watch video - summarize a recording, transcribe it, answer questions, or cite timestamps - run it on a Google Gemini model and pass the video as a file input. Gemini reads both the visual and audio track natively.

```yaml
agent:
  model: google/gemini-3.5-flash
  system: system
```

Video understanding is model-dependent, and only Gemini reads video today. If you send a video file to a model that cannot see it (Anthropic, OpenAI), the platform does not silently hand over a useless URL - it tells the model the file is a video it cannot watch, and validation warns you at authoring time. The idiomatic pattern for an agent whose main model cannot see video is to define a **worker** on a Gemini model and delegate video files to it (see [Workers](/docs/protocol/workers)); the video is read once inside the worker, and only the text result returns to the parent.

Uploaded videos up to 100MB (mp4, webm, quicktime, mpeg) are delivered to Gemini by URL - no size handling on your side.

### Generating video

Set `videoModel` to enable the agentic `octavus_generate_video` tool, exactly like `imageModel` enables `octavus_generate_image`:

```yaml
agent:
  model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-5
  system: system
  videoModel: google/veo-3.1-fast-generate-preview
  agentic: true
```

The tool generates a short clip (a few seconds) from a text prompt, and optionally from a starting image (image-to-video). It supports `aspectRatio` (landscape `16:9` or portrait `9:16`), an optional `durationSeconds`, and an optional native-audio track. The clip is stored in Octavus storage and delivered into the conversation as a playable file, exactly like a generated image.

Video generation is Google-only today (Veo). Generation runs a slow provider job (tens of seconds to a couple of minutes) inside the turn, so the tool call stays pending until the clip is ready. Cancelling the run abandons it without delivering a partial clip.

| Provider | Model examples                                                                                                       |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Google   | `veo-3.1-generate-preview`, `veo-3.1-fast-generate-preview`, `veo-3.1-lite-generate-preview`, `veo-3.0-generate-001` |

Use the `generate-video` block (see [Handlers](/docs/protocol/handlers)) for deterministic, pipeline-style generation, the same way `generate-image` mirrors `imageModel`.

## Speech Generation

Set `speechModel` to enable the agentic `octavus_generate_speech` tool, exactly like `imageModel` enables `octavus_generate_image`:

```yaml
agent:
  model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-5
  system: system
  speechModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini-tts
  speechVoice: marin # optional default voice
  agentic: true
```

The tool turns a block of text into natural spoken audio and delivers it into the conversation as a playable audio file (with a download option) - the agent receives a reference (URL, format, size), never raw bytes. It supports an optional `voice`, an output `format` (default `mp3`), optional delivery `instructions`, and an optional `language`. The advertised voices and formats are narrowed to what the configured model supports, so the LLM only ever picks a valid option. Set `speechVoice` (a literal voice id or a variable reference) to fix the default voice used when the model does not specify one.

| Provider | Model examples                         |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| OpenAI   | `gpt-4o-mini-tts`, `tts-1`, `tts-1-hd` |

Use the `generate-speech` block (see [Handlers](/docs/protocol/handlers)) for deterministic, pipeline-style generation, the same way `generate-image` mirrors `imageModel`.

## Transcription

Set `transcriptionModel` to enable the agentic `octavus_transcribe_audio` tool:

```yaml
agent:
  model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-5
  system: system
  transcriptionModel: openai/gpt-4o-transcribe
  agentic: true
```

The tool takes the URL of an audio (or video) file and returns its transcript as text - so transcription works regardless of whether the chat model can natively "hear" the file. It auto-detects the spoken language by default, accepts an optional `language` hint, and can return timestamped segments (`timestamps: true`) where the model supports them (for OpenAI, `whisper-1`). Short transcripts return inline; long transcripts are delivered as a downloadable transcript file with only a bounded preview returned, so a multi-hour transcript never floods the model context.

| Provider | Model examples                                             |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| OpenAI   | `gpt-4o-transcribe`, `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe`, `whisper-1` |

The dedicated transcription API has per-request size/duration limits (OpenAI: ~25 MB / ~25 min). To transcribe long recordings in one pass, point a worker at a long-context multimodal model (e.g. Gemini) and delegate the file to it - the model transcribes or summarizes the whole recording directly. Use the `transcribe-audio` block (see [Handlers](/docs/protocol/handlers)) for deterministic, pipeline-style transcription.

## Web Search

Enable the LLM to search the web for current information:

```yaml
agent:
  model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
  system: system
  webSearch: true
  agentic: true
```

When `webSearch` is enabled, the `octavus_web_search` tool becomes available. The LLM can decide when to search the web based on the conversation. Search results include source URLs that are emitted as citations in the UI.

This is a **provider-agnostic** built-in tool - it works with any LLM provider (Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, etc.). For Anthropic's own web search implementation, see [Provider Options](/docs/protocol/provider-options).

Use cases:

- Current events and real-time data
- Fact verification and documentation lookups
- Any information that may have changed since the model's training

## TODO List

Enable the LLM to maintain a structured task list while it works:

```yaml
agent:
  model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
  system: system
  todoList: true
  agentic: true
```

When `todoList` is enabled, the `octavus_todo_write` tool becomes available. The LLM creates and updates a list of items - each with `id`, `content`, and `status` (`pending`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `cancelled`) - and the platform emits a `todo-update` stream event with the resolved snapshot. The Client SDK accumulates updates into a single `UITodoPart` per assistant message, so consumers render an evolving "Plan" card without managing state themselves.

The list persists across messages: the LLM can use `merge=true` to update items by id (sending only the changed fields), or `merge=false` to replace the list entirely.

Use cases:

- Multi-step tasks where the user benefits from seeing progress
- Long-running agentic loops that should communicate intent
- Workflows where the agent plans before acting

## Temperature

Control response randomness:

```yaml
agent:
  model: openai/gpt-4o
  temperature: 0.7 # 0 = deterministic, 2 = creative
```

**Guidelines:**

- `0 - 0.3`: Factual, consistent responses
- `0.4 - 0.7`: Balanced (good default)
- `0.8 - 1.2`: Creative, varied responses
- `> 1.2`: Very creative (may be inconsistent)

## Dynamic Configuration

Like `model`, the `temperature`, `thinking`, `speed`, and `maxSteps` fields can also reference an input variable. Consumers choose values at session creation, so the same agent can be tuned per call without protocol changes:

```yaml
input:
  TEMPERATURE:
    type: number
    description: Override temperature (0-2)
    optional: true
  THINKING:
    type: string
    description: Override thinking effort (low/medium/high/max, or "off")
    optional: true
  MAX_STEPS:
    type: integer
    description: Override max agentic steps
    optional: true

agent:
  model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
  temperature: TEMPERATURE
  thinking: THINKING
  maxSteps: MAX_STEPS
  system: system
```

When creating a session, pass the values in their natural type:

```typescript
const sessionId = await client.agentSessions.create('my-agent', {
  TEMPERATURE: 0.7,
  THINKING: 'medium',
  MAX_STEPS: 5,
});
```

### Accepted values

The resolver accepts the natural type for each field, plus a string fallback so consumers can pass values from form inputs without coercing first.

| Field         | Suggested input type                       | Value at session creation                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `temperature` | `number` (or `string` for `"off"` support) | A number `0`-`2`, a numeric string, or `"off"`     |
| `thinking`    | `string`                                   | `"low"`, `"medium"`, `"high"`, `"max"`, or `"off"` |
| `maxSteps`    | `integer` (or `string`)                    | A positive integer or a positive integer string    |

The protocol's `input:` declaration enforces what the consumer can pass. Pick `type: number` / `type: integer` if you want native numeric overrides; pick `type: string` (or `type: unknown`) if you also need to pass the `"off"` sentinel for `temperature`.

### Explicit "off" vs not set

`temperature` and `thinking` accept an explicit `"off"` value to disable the field at session creation. This is different from omitting the variable:

- **Variable not provided** -> the field is unset; the provider uses its default behavior
- **Variable provided as `"off"`** -> the field is explicitly disabled (no temperature emitted, reasoning disabled)

The distinction matters because `temperature` and `thinking` are mutually exclusive at the provider level - several providers ignore temperature when reasoning is enabled. Use `"off"` to opt one out so the other takes effect.

### Validation

Variable references are caught at protocol validation time. If `temperature: TEMPERATURE` is declared but `TEMPERATURE` is missing from `input:` or `variables:`, the validator surfaces the error in the dashboard before the agent runs.

## Provider Options

Enable provider-specific features like Anthropic's built-in tools and skills:

```yaml
agent:
  model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
  anthropic:
    tools:
      web-search:
        display: description
        description: Searching the web
    skills:
      pdf:
        type: anthropic
        description: Processing PDF
```

Provider options are validated against the model - using `anthropic:` with a non-Anthropic model will fail validation.

See [Provider Options](/docs/protocol/provider-options) for full documentation.

## Thread-Specific Config

Override config for named threads:

```yaml
handlers:
  request-human:
    Start summary thread:
      block: start-thread
      thread: summary
      model: anthropic/claude-opus-4-8 # Different model
      backupModel: openai/gpt-4o # Failover model
      thinking: low # Different thinking
      speed: fast # Fast mode for this thread (supported Opus models only)
      cache: off # Different cache mode (does not inherit from agent)
      maxSteps: 1 # Limit tool calls
      system: escalation-summary # Different prompt
      mcpServers: [figma, browser] # Thread-specific MCP servers
      skills: [data-analysis] # Thread-specific skills
      references: [escalation-policy] # Thread-specific references
      imageModel: google/gemini-2.5-flash-image # Thread-specific image model
      webSearch: true # Thread-specific web search
      todoList: true # Thread-specific task list
```

Each thread can have its own model, backup model, thinking level, speed, cache mode, MCP servers, skills, references, image model, web search setting, and task list setting. Skills must be defined in the protocol's `skills:` section. References must exist in the agent's `references/` directory. Workers use this same pattern since they don't have a global `agent:` section - which is how a worker enables fast mode.
