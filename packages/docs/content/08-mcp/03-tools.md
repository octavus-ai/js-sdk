# Tools

The server exposes a focused set of tools. Read tools are available on any connection; **write** tools appear only on a read-and-write connection. Lists are paginated (pass the `nextCursor` from a previous response to get the next page).

Tools are namespaced by product surface: `*_platform_*` tools work with the agents you build yourself, and `*_workforce_*` tools work with your Octavus Agents. They are different things and never overlap.

## Platform agents

The agents you build with the SDK/CLI, inside a project - distinct from your [Octavus Agents](#octavus-agents) below. `get_platform_agent` and `archive_platform_agent` take the agent's `agentId` from `list_platform_agents`; `deploy_platform_agent` addresses the agent by the `slug` in its settings (like `octavus sync`).

| Tool                      | Access | Description                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `list_projects`           | read   | List the projects you can access.                                                                              |
| `list_platform_agents`    | read   | List the platform agents in a project.                                                                         |
| `get_platform_agent`      | read   | Get an agent as CLI-format files: `settings`, `protocol.yaml`, `prompts`, `references`.                        |
| `validate_platform_agent` | read   | Validate an agent definition without saving (dry run), like `octavus validate`.                                |
| `deploy_platform_agent`   | write  | Create or update an agent from CLI-format files, like `octavus sync`. Supports partial (changed-only) updates. |
| `archive_platform_agent`  | write  | Archive an agent (soft delete): it stops appearing in the project and its slug is freed; history is preserved. |

### Editing an agent

A typical write loop mirrors the CLI:

1. `get_platform_agent` to fetch the current files.
2. Edit locally.
3. `validate_platform_agent` to check the change.
4. `deploy_platform_agent` to apply it. By default only the files you send change and the rest are preserved; set `replace: true` to replace the full prompt/reference set.

## Sessions

Sessions belong to platform agents.

| Tool                | Access | Description                                                                   |
| ------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `list_sessions`     | read   | List recent sessions in a project, optionally filtered to one platform agent. |
| `get_session_trace` | read   | Get a session's execution trace as readable markdown for debugging.           |

Traces are available while the session log is warm (about 24 hours after the run). Noisy model-request telemetry is excluded by default; pass `includeModelRequests: true` to include it.

## Octavus Agents

Your Octavus Agents (the "workforce") - distinct from the platform agents above. Identify one by its `agentId` from `list_workforce_agents`.

| Tool                      | Access | Description                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `list_workforce_agents`   | read   | List the Octavus Agents you can access.                                                                                                      |
| `list_workforce_threads`  | read   | List an agent's chat threads (needs its `agentId`).                                                                                          |
| `read_workforce_thread`   | read   | Read a thread's messages and status (needs `agentId` + `threadId`). Pass `wait: true` to long-poll (bounded ~25s; may return still-running). |
| `send_to_workforce_agent` | write  | Send a message to an agent by `agentId`, starting or continuing a thread.                                                                    |

### Sending a task and reading the result

Because agent runs are asynchronous, driving one is a two-step pattern:

1. `send_to_workforce_agent` with the `agentId` (from `list_workforce_agents`) and your message. It returns a `threadId`.
2. `read_workforce_thread` with that agent's `agentId`, the `threadId`, and `wait: true`. The wait is bounded (~25 seconds): it returns the messages as soon as the run finishes, but if the run is still going it returns `isRunning: true` and you must call `read_workforce_thread` again - repeat until `isRunning` is false.

## Skills

Read any [skill](/docs/protocol/skills) available to your organization, and - on a read-and-write connection, if your account can manage skills - author your organization's custom skills without leaving your editor. Reads cover your custom skills plus the public Octavus skills; writes only ever touch your own custom skills.

| Tool           | Access | Description                                                                                                                        |
| -------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `list_skills`  | read   | List the skills available to your organization (custom + public Octavus), with slug, description, version, category, and secrets.  |
| `get_skill`    | read   | Read a skill's full `SKILL.md` (frontmatter + body) and its `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files, by id or slug.         |
| `save_skill`   | write  | Create or update a custom skill by slug (create if new, update if it exists). Files merge by path; `replace: true` swaps them all. |
| `delete_skill` | write  | Archive a custom skill by id or slug (soft delete; the slug is freed for reuse).                                                   |

### Authoring a skill

The write loop mirrors editing an agent:

1. `fetch_documentation` with the slug `protocol/skills` to read the `SKILL.md` contract (frontmatter fields, scripts, secrets).
2. Design the `SKILL.md` body and any `scripts/` locally (or `get_skill` an existing one to edit it).
3. `save_skill` with the `slug`, `description`, `body`, and `files`. Send only the files that changed - they merge by path - or pass `replace: true` to replace the whole set.

`save_skill` can **declare** the secrets a skill needs (the `secrets` frontmatter), but it never sets secret **values**: those are configured per organization in the Octavus dashboard and stay UI-only.

## Models

Look up the models you can use in an agent - each with a copy-ready id like `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` or `openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-chat` - so you can pick one or compare costs without leaving your editor. Available on any connection; the same catalog shown at [octavus.ai/pricing/models](https://octavus.ai/pricing/models).

| Tool          | Access | Description                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `list_models` | read   | List the models you can use in an agent, with a copy-ready id, display name, provider, routing, context length, and per-1M-token pricing. Optionally filter by `provider`. |

Outside your editor, the same catalog is available as a public REST endpoint - see the [Models API](/docs/api-reference/models).

## Documentation

Read the Octavus documentation from inside your AI tool, so it can answer from the real docs instead of guessing or browsing the web. Both tools are available on any connection.

| Tool                   | Access | Description                                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `search_documentation` | read   | Search the docs for matching pages (slug, title, section, excerpt). Omit the query to list every page. |
| `fetch_documentation`  | read   | Fetch a full documentation page as markdown by its `slug` (from `search_documentation`).               |

A typical loop is two steps: `search_documentation` with a query to find the right page, then `fetch_documentation` with the returned `slug` to read it.
